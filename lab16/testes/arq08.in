the gentleman then informed me that the spirit of socrates had delivered this special revelation
in the course of the night my friend i hope you are pretty well there are two in this
railway carriage how do you do there are seventeen thousand four hundred and seventy nine spirits
here but you cannot see them pythagoras is here he is not at liberty to mention it but hopes you
like travelling galileo likewise had dropped in with this scientific intelligence
i am glad to see you amico come sta water will freeze when it is cold enough addio
in the course of the night also the following phenomena had occurred
bishop butler had insisted on spelling his name bubler
for which offence against orthography and good manners he had been dismissed as out of temper
john milton suspected of wilful mystification had repudiated the authorship of paradise lost
and had introduced as joint authors of that poem two unknown gentlemen respectively named
grungers and scadgingtone and prince arthur nephew of king john of england
had described himself as tolerably comfortable in the seventh circle
where he was learning to paint on velvet under the direction of mrs trimmer and mary queen of scots
if this should meet the eye of the gentleman who favoured me with these disclosures
i trust he will excuse my confessing that the sight of the rising sun
and the contemplation of the magnificent Order of the vast Universe made me impatient of them
in a word i was so impatient of them that i was mightily glad to get out at the next station and to
exchange these clouds and vapours for the free air of heaven
